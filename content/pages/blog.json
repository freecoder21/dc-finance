    "excerpt": "In the CRE (Commercial Real Estate) sector, you always need to be prepared for surprises and the unexpected.\n\nOften, investors see a shopping center or a Mixed-Use property for sale, and everything looks good, with great financials, great lease terms, etc., but when it comes to financing, they get stuck.\n\nWhat's the reason?\n\nWhile every deal has its unique scenarios, here is a critical detail investor’s sometimes overlook.\n\nWhen purchasing a shopping center, lenders often reject financing if there's a Deli/Takeout.\n\n\nHere's why.\n\n1. Delis can often be quite messy, and cooking smells can seep into the shopping center, affecting other tenants and potentially deterring customers.\n\n2. Food attracts pests, and a poorly managed restaurant can become a breeding ground for unwelcome animals (Such as rats).\n \n\nKeep this in mind when considering financing for a retail center or any commercial building that includes a restaurant.\n\nP.S As always, it doesn't mean it is impossible to finance a restaurant. There will always be a way to get to the closing table. \n\n",
